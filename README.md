## About ⁉
This is a study and training project from the ETEC school related to the FNAF saga. It contains a little about the history of each game, a movie trailer, a FICTITIOUS store and an amateur quiz that I tried to make so that if you get the answer wrong you get a jumpscare, but the video doesn't play automatically because the browser blocks it. But it was a good learning experience!
